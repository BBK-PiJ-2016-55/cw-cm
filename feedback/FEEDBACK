Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Okay set of tests.

Add javadoc even for private fields and methods.

If a method throws an exception explicitly then consider adding
a "throws" clause even if the exception is unchecked. This is
good documentation and a strong indication to the user of your
api that an exception may occur.

Some of the methods are very similar and strong candidates for
refactoring. Some of the similarity could have been avoided by
using Java 8 constructs which you should consider using going 
forward.

Good attempt. Distinction.
